Revision history for WebService-EveOnline

0.01    11 Dec 2007 / 17:00 GMT
        First version of WebService::EveOnline.
        There's still some way to go before this is anything like
        complete, but it's a start. :-)

        Lots of restructuring, with particular attention paid to
        making the interface a lot more consistent. Slowly moving
        the old-style hashref-based datastructures into
        class-based accessors (with hashref methods added if this
        is desired.

        This release breaks compatability with the first release,
        but should provide a firmer basis on which to proceed.

        Transaction history has been added, as well as the
        beginnings of support for the other parts of the API.

        Caching is now more finely grained, which is particularly
        important when it comes to wallet functions, which can
        only be requested once per hour (otherwise generates an
        API error).

        EVE API check has been updated from Version 1 to Version 2
        It is unclear what changes have been made to the API at
        this time.

        Added some example scripts for good measure.
