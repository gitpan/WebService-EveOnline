Revision history for WebService-EveOnline

0.01    11 Dec 2007 / 17:00 GMT
        First version of WebService::EveOnline.
        There's still some way to go before this is anything like
        complete, but it's a start. :-)

        Slight tinkering, which didn't make it into a release
        package but is probably in the svn history somewhere.

        This tinkering lead to:

        Lots of restructuring, with particular attention paid to
        making the interface a lot more consistent. Slowly moving
        the old-style hashref-based datastructures into
        class-based accessors (with hashref methods added if this
        is desired).

        This release breaks compatability with the first release,
        but should provide a firmer basis on which to proceed.

        Transaction history has been added, as well as the
        beginnings of support for the other parts of the API.

        Caching is now more finely grained, which is particularly
        important when it comes to wallet functions, which can
        only be requested once per hour (otherwise generates an
        API error).

        EVE API check has been updated from Version 1 to Version 2
        It is unclear what changes have been made to the API at
        this time.

        Added some example scripts for good measure.

        Yikes. Some of the core documentation bears very little
        relation to how things actually work now. Oops.

        Caching now doesn't store errors resulting from the
        Eve API. An additional parameter (user id) is now stored
        as part of the cache_key, preventing a situation whereby
        the wrong data is returned if you switch API keys (this
        only affected returning character data tied to an API
        key, but now we do this pervasively).

        If EVE_API_KEY and EVE_USER_ID are set in the environment,
        they are used in lieu of passed-down values. This has
        proved surprisingly handy in development (for writing one-
        liner tests), so I've decided to include it as a supported
        feature (at least for now :-) ).

        A publically available subversion repository for this
        code has been set up here:
